diabetes,I am type 2 diabetic and my A1c went from 11.9% to 5.6% in 6 months through a weird diet.,PartyMarch542,2024-09-07 21:06:31,0,1fbn6ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1fbn6ox/i_am_type_2_diabetic_and_my_a1c_went_from_119_to/,"Hi, I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2013. I never took meds and only checked glucose for first months. I did cut back on my sugar intake, but it was sloppy.

I noticed neuropathy in my feet the last year or two. The beginning of February this year, I heard a clip of Jordan Peterson where he has been on some diet called the Lion Diet where he only eats meat for several years now. I though ""what?"" But being a knowledge seeker, I dove into looking at this concept I had never heard of. Not knowing at the time the name of his, I was actually looking at the Carnivore diet, and that was when I decided to give it a six month commitment.

I had never gotten blood work out of interest, only when sick, or the military had me get a physical at certain times in my career, but wanting to be scientific, I made an appointment and my doctor had me get all the labs the carnivore guy I was following on YouTube recommended. My doctor told me I was going to die from high ldl cholesterol doing this diet. (more on this later) I told her I was only planning to do it for six months and see where I was at that point.

Well, I got home after labs and doctor visit, and the nurse called and said, get back here, your A1c is 11.9%, you need a shot of Insulin now and you need to start taking Metformin. I said, ok, let me call you back. I thought, I was not even going to know my A1C if I was not trying this crazy zero carb diet, so I started looking at videos on A1c, medicine and carnivore impact. I called the nurse and explained that I think we should see how my diet impacts it and try a test in 3 months. She said, let's do one month. I agreed. I thought the best I could expect was a 1.5%-2%  if I was SUPER disciplined. On March 27th I went to the lab and on to the doctor's office, and I was at 9.0%. My doctor said the word ""wow"" 4 or 5 times during our appointment. She said, everyone says they will diet, but does not. She said, if I can stay the course, I do not need meds. I returned at 3 months and it was 6.4%, and finally about a week ago, on Aug 28th I was at 5.6% A1c.

I ran my plan going forward by my doctor. I said I am planning to reintroduce carbs little by little while checking for spikes with he intent to follow non-diabetic spike patterns of 190. Once I exceed that, I will back off the carb intake about 25% and make that my number.

As the doctor I followed on YT who I thought was level headed said: very few people probably ought to be on a zero carb intake. He said that some folks can handle 100 carbs a day, some 50, some can do 20 and be fine.

Anyways, my doctor approved and liked my plan.

My experience:

1. I lost about 2lbs a week until I hot about 190lbs and then put on about 5lbs. Total weight lost 15lbs. This was disappointing as I was hoping to get to 170.
2. My wife started the diet after I was on it for about 2 months and she liked the impact until her hair started falling out, so she got off it.
3. My neuropathy decreased to almost non-existent.
4. I am now 5.6% A1c which is non-diabetic number.
5. I am 56 and I can recall 50 years and I cannot remember not being addicted to sugar. I would attend a birthday party last year and knowing I do not need sugar, I would have a thin slace while everyone else had a regular slice. I would have a small scoop of ice cream. Well, I would do this about 8 times and end up having 3x what everyone else did. Now, my daughter will eat icecream and cake as she did this last week, and I do not crave it. I did scrap all diet soda, because the fake sweeteners still give you sweet tooth...or more accurately ""give me a craving."" I feel like Smegal getting rid of the ring of sugar. I am free!
6. FYI, for the first 3 months, I only ate for 6 hours a day and fasted for 18 hours. So, if I ate first food at 6AM, I was done for day at 12PM. I thought I would be starved by the time morning came around, yet I was not even hungry and might even work for a little before eating. This was a far cry from opening the fridge for a snack every time I passed it.
7. I felt a little weaker on occasion. Usually not.
8. for the first few weeks, I had a sense that my spine was realigning. I know that sounds weird, but that was what it felt like.
9. For spicing up my drinks, I bought a soda stream machine and a 20lb cylinder of CO2 with a hose to attach the two which brought the price of carbonated water from about .50 at Walmart to about .02 a 12 oz serving. This provided carbonated water that I would put a small piece of lime or a dropper of coconut extract. I also found the recipe for electrolyte powder and got the cost down from $1.30 a packet to about .02 (guess).
10. I stopped coffee for first two months.
11. I was not a cultist mind. Some folks say: ""when did you see a wolf drink coffee"" (CARNIVORE diet). I also had some carbs from spices, mustard, and probably my highest carb intake was cottage cheese which is about 5gr per 1/2 cup. So, I was not really zero and I probably was close to 10 carbs by month 2 or 3. As you saw I put lime in my water which was probably 1/2 a carb??
12. My lab results the other day showed my cholesterol was good. I can probably ;login to my medical portal and get my lab info.  Of course, this was only six months. I did hear from a cancer researcher doctor Seyfried of Boston University about a patient who had a brain tumor that was inoperable and had very short life expectancy. He got on a zero carb diet and 8 years later the tumor is not growing because cancer needs glucose for glutamine for food. He tried to start eating carbs after some years, but tumor started growing immediately in the MRI, so he went back on the diet. I added this as an interesting bunny trail. I certainly will look further into it if God forbid we get hit with cancer in our household.

Ldl cholesterol and the leading cause of heart disease. Apparently in the 1980's there was a battle as to the culprit that caused this number one killer. The debate waged between carbs and cholesterol, and by the end of the 80's it was concluded that ldl Cholesterol was the bad guy. Well, after I was told of the risk I read and watched quote a bit of info on the topic and when that one month appointment was wrapping up, I told my doctor (respectfully and gently) that I had read that many doctor's do not agree that the ldl was the culprit and there seems to be a lot of data to support this challenge to convention. She said: ""I know that, and I agree."" I then ever so gently asked her why she said I was going to die from heart disease because of the ldl?

She said that there is a thing called ""standards of care"" that are the government rules that she has to uphold or she is guilty of medical malpractice and will lose her license. She went on to explain that the fact I went online and asked ""is this true?"" and arrived at the truth, good for me. I am not putting this to say I found the truth. I just thought it was interesting. I was tempted to be angry with her for knowingly in her mind misleading me, but that is easy to say when you are not the one with medical school loans, a mortgage and family reliant on you not losing the 8 year investment to get to doctor status.

Overall, I am very glad I did the diet. I am interested to see how my diet goes as I increase carbs and what my A1c will be like when I go back in 6 months for blood work.",positive,0.9986670017242432,interested in clinical trials,positive,0.9986670017242432,positive experience with clinical trials,positive,0.9986670017242432,wants to participate in clinical trials

diabetes,What test did to do at the clinic to get detected for type 1 / type 2 or pre diabetes ?,twelvepoodles,2024-07-24 02:28:49,1,1eavcz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1eavcz6/what_test_did_to_do_at_the_clinic_to_get_detected/,"(This post is not medical advice, this is just what I decided to do because I had a whole month without guidance from my medical provider.)

    My husband and I(F34) were planning for a family and I got my blood tested for a future 1st pregnancy. On November 8th 2023 my blood-work, and Hba1c came back 9.6. My next test came back on Nov. 15th at 9.5. I don’t really remember any symptoms besides I always drank a lot of water which I thought was normal and healthy amounts. I suppose, looking back I urinated once every hour, which I thought was relatively normal due to how much liquids I drank 64-96 oz (water, green tea, diet soda).  I am considered just at the overweight mark BMI 29.9.
    
    Healthcare paused, we lost insurance for a month due to husbands positive career change on the 31st of Nov. no meds and no communication. Nothing, except me stewing in my stubbornness for the next month...
    
    We both went through the 5 stages of grief because we couldn’t do what we wanted to right when we wanted to (have lots of unprotected sex). I experienced some denial, jealousy and anger at the fact that why is this happening to me? Wasn’t I doing every thing right? Why can all these other women have children? Why can’t I? What's wrong with me? A lot of these thoughts and feeling fueled a kind of stubbornness and determination that has encouraged me in a positive way to exercise and eat healthier.
    
    I was able to get my OneTouch VerioFlex in time with insurance but no medications, prescribed too late. BTW dawn phenomenon is so frustrating! Started making sure I got at least 10,000 steps a day and trying to get 150 mins of moderate to high intensity exercise a week, I’m not so good at the mod to intense exercise. I also with the help of the meter I discover that carbs and starch foods were bad and started doing more research. I lurked and read a lot of posts on /r/diabetes and /r/diabetest2. This led me to the keto diet and more specifically an omnivore ketogenic diet fueled with healthy fats and a blend of meats/ plant based protein (chicken, fish, tofu, vegetarian products, lots of eggs!, and some red meats) lots of non starchy vegs and lots of healthy fats( olive oil, avocados, etc.). During this month I also incorporated intermittent fasting due to my dawn phenomenon and not wanting to spike myself further.
    
    Fast forward to this week, I’m back on insurance on the 1st of January and my pcp wonders if I am type 1.5. I get tested and my GAD-65 is 106 high and positive for t1.5.  I am definitely processing this again, a few tears again, frustrated, angry, and a little bit happy to know. It makes sense, my mom has like 3 autoimmune disorders.

(TLDR) Recently diagnosed t1.5 female, planning for pregnancy, looking for tips, (not medical advise), questions (below), and general camaraderie.

    Pcp has ordered my a referral for an endocrinologist. I'm waiting for that call.  I wonder how long I will have to wait to see the endo? How long did it take you to get it under control. Any books to recommend me?  
    
    Also, any other moms or future moms out there? Also, are there any dads and/or future dads out there experiencing this like my husband and I? How is it going in supporting your partners with this? How did pregnancy go for you while controlling your diabetes?

SARMs are selective androgen receptor modulators, effectively anabolic steroids. Taken orally, highly bioavailable, they are designed to be selective of the androgen receptor such that they have more anabolic qualities (muscle building) and less androgenic (masculinising - hair growth etc.). It is for this reason it’s a preference for a lot of female bodybuilders.

Ostarine is also excellent for not shutting down your production of hormones, or it does so very mildly over a long time, and recovery is quick. 

The dose in this study was 3mg daily for 3 months which is a very small dose relative to what bodybuilders use (10-25mg), and resulted in a 25% reduction in insulin resistance. 

All in the study had slightly elevated liver enzymes, so this would need to be something cycled on and off. And elevated liver enzymes is not a concern, as the liver is extremely resilient - unlike your kidneys, arteries and entire cardiovascular system which are damaged by insulin resistance.

I hope this isn't a silly question and I apologize if it is.

I've had odd blood sugar readings for a long time (eating disorder) and I'm just thinking to myself about this question. Wouldn't it be the same to have prediabetes for a long time, maybe 5.7-6.4 A1C for years, during the holidays eat bad, get a 6.5 A1C, then bring it back down? How is that 6.5 A1C cut off immediately type 2 diabetes and not brought back down to prediabetes when A1C is normalized (or less than 6.5 A1C)?

Why would someone be diabetic the rest of their life due to it being high for three months straight then going back down, potentially forever if someone were to do so? Wouldn't that just be glucose intolerant (which I know could be a fancy word for type 2 diabetes)? I guess I just don't get why someone who is prediabetic could be that for a loooong time and slip up to 6.5 and immediately be diabetic for their entire life, even if they were to not have to be medicated later on in life and their A1C is normalized, blood sugar, everything.

Is prediabetes not reversible? Wouldn't prediabetes, in this case, be just as bad as diabetes?

The best advice I got was when I collapsed, was taken to the emergency room, and was diagnosed.

I didn't need much convincing because according to doctors, I was 2 hours from death when I was brought into the hospital, but I have found the advice I received to be correct. I think one thing that some diabetics who are resisting the change might not fully understand is that the way they feel now might be what they have become accustomed to, but it is not good, and by making some changes they can feel better. 

As far as ""bad"" advice, I have heard things like diabetes can be cured through positive thinking, exercise is bad for diabetics, eat whatever you want, whenever you want, just take more insulin.

I genuinely can't fathom how I people don't go insane from this. Like, I have had to re-evaluate my dreams since I was diagnosed. I cannot stress how this feels like some sick joke by God, the day after I got home from the hospital I tried smartfood white cheddar popcorn and it was really, really good, I wanted more of course but I couldn't cause 2 servings is more than 15 carbs. The week after that there's a snowcone truck outside of my school, and I'm sitting alone watching all the other kids have fun while I just listen to Leviathan.

And remember how I said I had to re-evaluate my dreams? At first I wanted to travel the world after I graduate, you know?

But if a child is making fun of you or demonizing you cause you already took your insulin and refuse to share a muffin you get in a bit of a piss poor mood:(

Please feel free to delete this post if it is against the rules or if my question is offensive, I am just asking people in this community because you all seem knowledgable and open.

I'm a Malaysian living in Houston for work, and I admit I used to be ignorant of Type 2 diabetes and thought it only happened to old people. I was very surprised when my 27 year old cousin back in Malaysia told me he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and my coworker here also said his nephew was just diagnosed at the age of 30. My cousin lost 42 kg/93 lbs in 18 months and now he says his doctor tells him he does not need any diabetes medications. He is now 180cm and 66 kg (I believe that's 5'11 and 150 pounds). I made a joke about all the food we will eat to celebrate his health when I come home to visit in a few months, but he stopped me to tell me that he is not cured, and that his body will still not process carbohydrates and sugars properly. He explained to me that his average glucose is fine, but if he eats rice and noodles he will still get sick. He also talked about how there's no cure coming and that most treatments and medicines for Type 2 diabetes is centered around helping people lose weight, which he has already done. He seemed a little bit depressed about it, it is the saddest I've seen him in a while. I feel bad for him because Malaysian food is wonderful and while we can avoid sugar, it is very difficult to try to eat without rice and noodles.

After a little bit of Googling (go ahead and tell me I'm an idiot for doing it), it seems to me that most treatments for Type 2 diabetics assume that the person has a high fasting and average glucose, which my cousin does not have but he says he may have it in the future as he grows older even with his new diet and lifestyle. I see that people are creating newer and easier ways to manage insulin therapy for Type 1 diabetics that Type 2 diabetics can also use if they ever go on insulin, but that seems to be it.

EDIT: I just re read my post and have to apologize for certain things

diabetes,what blood glucose levels and for how many days leads to damage to the pancreas which causes type 2 diabetes ?,asdfghqw8,2021-08-28 08:57:13,0,pda84i,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/pda84i/what_blood_glucose_levels_and_for_how_many_days/,"I've been diagnosed with type 1 since 2013 at age 11, now at an HbA1c of 6,2%. The way they learned me in hospital, I could just eat however many carbs I wanted, I worked with insulin ratios. So for example, for lunch I had to take 1 unit of insulin per 4 grams of carbs,, meaning that I had to take 7.5 units of insulin for a 30 g carbs meal, but I could also decide to only eat 24 grams of carbs for 6 units if I wanted to. 
Food rules weren't that strict, just whole wheat bread and pasta instead of the white versions, only sugar free sweets and soda, stuff like that. 

Later I switched hospitals and their dietary advice was stricter there and they worked a bit differently, but said that I could just stick to my carb ratios if that worked for me.


Nowadays I eyeball most stuff but I've become pretty good at it, and just ignore most dietary guidelines in favor of intuitive eating because the 'good/bad foods' rethoric began to trigger disordered eating. When I go to my diabetes appointments, everyone tells me I'm doing a great job, just have to be less afraid of and strict with highs because otherwise I'll get too many hypos.

Life with diabetes hasn't been that troublesome for me honestly, some of the rules people here follow sound really crazy and strict to me and would immediately give me an eating disorder if I had to follow them honestly. Like people treating bread, pasta and rice as the devil and never eating bagels or pizza. Both type 1s, type 2s and other types (MODY, LADA,, 3c etc.).

Just stop eating carbohydrates. You will notice your BG readings drop to normal very quickly, (for me 3 days to stabilize). The most important instrument at your disposal to control your BG is your meter. It will tell you when you screw up. Simple as that. If you are like most T2s, your illness is caused by insulin resistance. Taking a drug that increases your production of insulin or actually taking insulin, will increase your insulin resistance. This is a nasty down hill slope that does not end well. Using diet and exercise to control BG levels is pretty simple. It also prevents any hypos from occurring. The problem for most of us is the willingness to change our diet. None of us like change. I don't. When I was diagnosed I went into a 2 week period of denial. Then I decided my life was not going to end in my 50s with all the complications that high BG levels cause.

I got used to this of extremely low carb food intake after about 6 months. I still sometimes fantasize about eating cheerios with banana slices on top. But of course that is not to be. There are so many choices of eating an extreme low carb diet that really I feel like compared to most residents of this planet, I eat like a king. I have been eating this way now for 20 years.

I did not invent this T2 treatment. My wife was diagnosed 25 years ago and read ""Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution: The Complete Guide to Achieving Normal Blood Sugars""

When I was diagnosed, I wanted to keep eating the way I always had. I worked at a medical school and knew several doctors well enough to consult with them about what to do. They all told me the same thing with the same ""none disclosure promise"" :-)  They told me to stop eating carbohydrates and I would be fine. They also told me that they were not my doctor and they did not tell me this.

Once you get used to eating like this it just starts becoming natural and easy. No hypos to worry about. I always measure my morning FBG. If I try a new food, I measure every 10 minutes for 3 hours to detect a spike. Any number over 140 can and will cause irreversible cellular damage. I don't have one of those nice devices that can give you continuous readings on your cell phone. I am considering the investment.

You can expect higher readings when you get ill. The body just starts producing too much sugar from the liver when you get sick. I don't know any way to prevent this. Even a common cold will elevate blood sugar.

I am not your doctor and I did not tell you this simple plan to gain normal BG levels.

So I’ve been seeing a guy for about 2 months now and after he stayed at my place over the weekend I realized I was severely underprepared. 

His insulin pump screamed at us one of the nights he was here because his blood sugar got really low. I live alone and don’t have much of a sweet tooth nor do I eat much so all I had to bring his sugar back up was some sweet tea (literally don’t even have jelly or jam in the house). It fixed it enough we were able to sleep and I just made him food first thing the next morning.

I have hypoglycemia in my family and some diabetes but I’m not around it much so I’m not sure what I can do to make life easier when he comes to my place. Today I bought some little Sunny D bottles and little mini muffins that one of my distant family members keep around for his diabetes but is there anything else I should get or maybe stash in my car or house?

I’ve thought maybe alcohol wipes in case his pump comes off (it’s sticky with a tiny needle on the sticky part and then a long cord to a fist sized tablet from what I’ve seen) or if the little robot on his arm comes off (haven’t seen that one come off but it seems similar to but bigger than the sticky part for his pump). 

He’s type 1 I believe if that changes anything.

Edit**** Y’all I was just shaken up by the blood sugar drop and want to be better prepared next time. Yes he’s a grown man and yes he can and does take care of himself. He’d just left his bag in his car and we were both too tired to fully think it through. In case that happens again or there’s some other freak thing that happens I want to be prepared and be a back up plan if need be. I do not understand why you seem to think that’s such a terrible thing. I have health conditions myself and know I appreciate when people do stuff to make life just a little bit easier or safer for me in their space.

I’ve also asked for him to give me a crash course on how his diabetes effects him specifically and how he manages it so I have a better understanding of it as a health condition and how I can assist him should he need me.

This month alone, she's been hospitalized three times, and her complications keep worsening. She blames everything but her habits.

She doesn’t eat healthily; she indulges in sweets and chocolates as if she weren't diabetic. She thinks it's okay because all she has to do is take insulin, regardless of how much sweets she consumes.

When she was younger, she would always leave her endocrinologist appointments in tears because her doctor would tell her she's not eating healthily, or properly managing her diabetes , and she would argue with them and tell them they’re wrong. To this day, she continues arguing with doctors, thinking she knows better since she studies medicine. Every time we try to advise her to eat better and take better care of herself, she gets defensive. She says we have no idea how hard her life is since we don’t have diabetes and always plays the victim.  It's condescending and hurtful because while it's true we don't have diabetes, we have researched it a fair deal and have spoken to her doctors, endocrinologists and doctors genuinely understand the struggles. We're not completely ignorant of the disease, as she claims, but she refuses to listen to us or anyone, thinking she knows best.

I'm even more stressed because our father just passed away due to his poorly managed diabetes and I'm scared she's going down the same path with her chronic DKAs. Her blood sugar levels are frequently in the 300-500 range, her feet have been incredibly swollen since arriving for our dad's funeral, she currently has a severe sinus infection that required her to get antibiotics. 

We had a terrible fight today because my mom confronted her about reusing her insulin needles. She has access to clean disposable needles. Going through our dad's belongings, we found hundreds of needle tips for her pen and hundreds of syringes, so there's no need. However, she said she doesn't want to carry around a lot of needles. She doesn't like to use the tips because she finds it more painful, so she reuses the syringes. We told her she can't reuse the syringes, especially because she's contaminating the entire vial. She thinks it's okay because she keeps the orange cap over the needle, but she just throws the needle in her purse, where it comes into contact with everything. I don’t need to be diabetic to know that’s not hygienic or safe. Her argument is that I don't have diabetes so I don't understand, and that she's been doing it since she was 12 and nothing bad has happened, so it's fine. But I know it just takes one time for it to turn into something serious.

I'm really worried about her but have no idea how to get through to her. How can I help her understand the seriousness without sounding insensitive after our fight because I did say some hurtful things in the heat of the moment. 


EDIT: to clarify, the only advice I’ve ever given her is that it’s unhygienic to reuse her syringes. I never gave her advice on what she should eat or how much or how little. I only added it to this post because I thought it’s what’s been causing her DKAs and for perspective- I do thank everyone who mentioned she’s probably not taking enough of her insulin which I do think is what the culprit could be. 


Edit 2: I don’t breathe over my sister’s neck, I have always given her the distance she needs and have NEVER given her unsolicited advice/or opinions on how she should live her life. I’m the only sister she’s in still in contact with and she does reach out to me for help and advice and we do have a complicated relationship but because we lived apart since she was 15 and not because of her diabetes. She discloses a lot of her feelings to me about other topics she just never talks about her diabetes because it’s a sensitive topic for her and I never push her to talk about it. This is the first argument we have ever had, so please don’t pretend like I’m some kind of overbearing sister who tries to control her life because I’m not, and I know she doesn’t think that about me.",positive,0.9983325600624084,interested in clinical trials,positive,0.9983325600624084,positive experience with clinical trials,positive,0.9983325600624084,wants to participate in clinical trials

diabetes,"Any scientific studies out there that try to find out what causes type 2 diabetes in thin people, other than the standard answer of genetics ?",asdfghqw8,2022-01-03 10:51:26,3,rv64sq,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/rv64sq/any_scientific_studies_out_there_that_try_to_find/,"Hello r/diabetes/,

I am a 40 year old male who was diagnosed with type-2 diabetes at the end of June, 2021 with an A1C of 9.4 after having been previously diagnosed as having prediabetes with an A1C of 6.1 in October of 2018.  After the initial prediabetes diagnosis in 2018, I swore off soda and endeavoured to ensure my next bloodwork result wouldn't be worse. After the prediabetes diagnosis, I was given a prescription for metformin, but my digestive tract had quite a bad time with that first attempt, and it quickly got lost in the shuffle of life.

What happened between October 2018 and June 2021? Birth of two kids (months of no sleep + chaos/stress of 2-under-2 years old at home), close family member diagnosed with Alzheimer's (stress) and pandemic (stress), during which time I reverted to my time-tested tradition of eating my stress away (translation: lots of carbs + soda).

After my t-2 diagnosis in June 2021, I decided it was imperative that I get my shit together and to better inform myself about what this diagnosis meant and how I could make sustainable lifestyle changes. One of my first Google searches landed me on Alan Shanley’s ( u/alan_s ) blog and the recommendation to test, test, test. I pulled out the dusty glucose meter that I bought back when I was diagnosed with prediabetes and started following the plan to test pre-meal, 1-hour post meal and 2-hours post meal to better inform myself of what the foods I was eating were doing to my glucose levels.

Alan’s advice, plus other things I learned reading Alan’s book (What on Earth Can I Eat) and Jenny Ruhl’s two books (Blood Sugar 101 and Diet 101) showed me that it was possible to control my blood sugar levels by paying attention to what I ate. I also realized how little I understood about nutrition, given that I never thought twice about the impact that foods like pasta, rice or bread were having on my blood sugar levels. I previously, obviously incorrectly, assumed that blood glucose levels were a function of drinking soda and eating sweets. <insert sad-sounding game show buzzer sound here>

Along the way, I also made an appointment with an endocrinologist who gave me a prescription for Ozempic after discussing my previous issue with metformin, along with a prescription for 10mg statin. I had cortisol, c-peptide and antibody bloodwork done via the endocrinologist to confirm that I was type-2 and not type-1. Best I  currently understand based on these results, my type-2 is due to insulin resistance due to years of terrible diet as I do not have insulin antibodies and my body is still producing insulin. As far as I know, there is no history of type-2 anywhere in my family. Shortly after getting the Ozempic prescription, I hit the part in Jenny’s book that discusses the potential issues with the pancreas associated with GLP-1 agonists and I then nope’d right out of that as an option. The endocrinologist had no issue pausing the Ozempic plan and seeing what I could do with diet/lifestyle changes.

Somewhere around the time of reading this initial set of books, I landed on a [YouTube video from a local cardiologist that kind of broke my brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFlZM5mlXTk). The video talks about the issues with the Western diet and how the ‘lots of carbs/starches with veggies/fruits and little fat’ USDA food pyramid that I grew up with was completely wrong, essentially that the pyramid was inverted and we should be eating fewer carbs (especially complex) and more healthy fats. There are a series of books at the end of his video which I purchased and have been working through. These books are continuing to re-write what little I knew about biology/nutrition. I was able to meet this cardiologist briefly when accompanying a family member to an appointment and he recommended looking into Dr. Jason Fung’s books (Obesity Code, Diabetes Code, Complete Guide to Fasting).

Dr. Fung’s books broke my brain all over again when I read about the impact that insulin had with regards to how the body regulates weight and also why my previously followed calories-in-calories-out (CICO) model of dieting didn’t work. One good bit about CICO is that I had been using the Lose It! app to track all of my food intake, so I already have a comprehensive food log that I can now pivot to using for macronutrient monitoring over time instead of strict calorie counting. Dr. Fung’s books also introduce the concept of intermittent fasting (IF) as a method for losing weight and managing glucose levels. I heard about IF in the past from colleagues who pointed me to the [2012 BBC documentary on the subject](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x370lox) and a [2019 article from the New England Journal of Medicine about the effects of IF](https://sa1s3.patientpop.com/assets/docs/151222.pdf).

I didn’t realize at the time, but I had been doing a form of IF for years (16/8), albeit with a terrible high-carb/high-sugar diet, by skipping breakfast so that I could get an extra few minutes of sleep in the morning. Given that I’d done the 16/8 for so long, I decided to try a 24 hour fast which went without issue, followed a few days later with a 46.5 hour fast which also went without much fuss (blood glucose levels stayed steady the entire time). These two fasting experiments have made me question everything I ever learned about eating habits e.g. (don’t skip breakfast, it’s the most important meal!). I am curious to see how Dr. Fung’s claims that IF can help reduce insulin resistance pan out as I attempt to follow a low-carb/high healthy fat/IF diet over the next few months.

Where does that leave me now? Two months after my initial diagnosis, my fasting glucose levels have dropped from 179mg/dL to \~95mg/dL (see [chart](https://imgur.com/Ec0nSOm) ) and the mySugr app that I have been using quasi-religiously (test before meal/1-hour after/2-hours after + fasting in morning) over the past month and half currently lists my estimated HbA1c at 5.4 (Libre reports GMI of 5.7). I have lost [30 pounds](https://imgur.com/fljq4TE) in the last 90 days after struggling with weight for years (number is likely a few pounds high due to the recent 46 hour fast which depleted glycogen stores).

I had bloodwork done about a month and a half after the initial diagnosis and found that my LDL cholesterol dropped from 125 to 84 and my triglycerides dropped from 319 to 116. Were those drops due to the statin, the diet change or both? Unsure as of yet, but I stopped taking the statin a week ago since it is known to increase insulin resistance and I’m more worried about that than my cholesterol at the moment. I have 3-month follow up bloodwork coming up soon, so I’ll find out more and discuss that further then. I also got a prescription for a Libre Freesytle 2 CGM which I [have been using for over a month](https://imgur.com/d9zowIA) . I liked the CGM at first, but I love it now that the iOS app is out in the United States. I also have a few weeks worth of CGM vs. traditional meter data, [like this](https://imgur.com/3rRB1cW), that I can share if there is interest, but the take home message for me is that the data the Libre 2 gives me matches very closely what my traditional meter (Verio OneTouch Reflect) measures and is quite helpful for watching trends and catching things I would have missed on my traditional meter after the 2-hour test mark.

All of that said, I am massively grateful to the /r/diabetes community (and related communities) for all of the posts and information available here, as they have made the start of this journey entirely more manageable and sustainable than it would have been otherwise. Where will I be a year from now? Who knows, but I’m optimistic that I have a much more concrete idea of what I should be doing diet-wise than I have been at any point in the past.

And I understand that exercise and weight loss (if applicable) are usually recommended as they help increase insulin sensitivity, along with metformin which helps with both insulin sensitivity and stopping the liver from dumping glucose. Many adopt a low carb diet as well to keep their blood sugar from rising throughout the day. 

Some type 2 diabetics are prescribed insulin when those things combined aren't helping bring down bg enough, even alongside a low carb diet.

Its been said around here that t1s can eat what they want, they just have to dose for it but t2s have to stick to low carb basically forever.


My question is, why can't type 2 diabetics just dose a bunch of insulin before a higher carb meal if they want to? I get that their ratio would be way higher, but would that not work?

Like, I get that purely insulin therapy would not work for t2s long term, nor would one want to if they could manage their diabetes with diet, excersise, and metformin alone. 

But on the occasion that they want to splurge and eat something more carb heavy without a huge bg rise, would an insulin dose be okay? Or if it is just a rare splurge, does it not matter enough in the long run to necessitate insulin?

Female, 29yo, 5’3, Diabetes T2, PCOS

I previously made two posts about being diagnosed with Diabetes Type 2 + DKA and recently my hair loss issue. My sugar was at 676 and my A1C was at 12.3 on 04/22/2024 the day I was hospitalized. Yesterday, Sept 10, I went for some lab work and I’m happy to say my A1C is at 4.8.

Initially the doc put me on Lantus, Humalog, Trulicity and Metformin. At my previous appointment a few days ago she dropped Humalog completely. My Lantus was lowered to only 8 units in the morning. 

A few days before I was hospitalized, my weight dropped from 148lbs to 132lbs, from the DKA. Since discharge my weight has been dropping and I’m at 117lbs. I have to say for most of my life I was skinny, usually around 100-105lbs. It wasn’t until 2020 when I started gaining weight because I started working from home and had a sedentary lifestyle. 

I still haven’t seen a specialist regarding nerve damage since I’m unemployed at the moment but I was prescribed gabapentin. After discharge I did experience a lot of pain and discomfort on my legs, toes and fingers but I’m not feeling it as much now. They feel mostly just kind of cold.

Here’s a note from my doc:

Your labs look much improved! A1C down to 4.8%. Kidney and liver function look good. All electrolytes in range. Your LDL (bad cholesterol) is still slightly elevated. Continue to work on diet and exercise and drinking plenty of water. Limit saturated fats and fried foods. No need for cholesterol medication at this time. No need for a liver ultrasound as your liver function looks stable on your lab work. Your liver enzymes (AST, ALT) have down trended.

So far my exercise has been to walk. I’m walking some mornings with my mom for maybe 40 minutes and then some afternoons I go to the gym and walk on the treadmill, with incline, for about 60-70 minutes. I’m trying to make it a habit. I’m Mexican and I eat cooked nopales and I noticed that they would drop my sugar below 70 every time I ate them. One glass of wine during dinner would have a similar effect but maybe that’s just coincidence since I’ve had wine maybe 4-5 times. I heard from someone with type 1 that eating your veggies before any meal helps and I have been doing that.

diabetes,My insulin levels are over 9000 and my doctor thinks I have type 1 and 2 diabetes,ThrowAwayAlt592,2020-06-18 18:44:16,0,hbprhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/hbprhc/my_insulin_levels_are_over_9000_and_my_doctor/,"I (19F) was diagnosed with diabetes last night. They don’t know what type yet, we ran labs today and I’m waiting to hear back.

I found out because I was feeling really sick yesterday and had a fever of 100.8. My mom told me to go to urgent care so I did. They tested for strep, flu, covid, and mono and all were negative. I asked if it could be a UTI and they had me do a urine test. They detected glucose in my urine and tested my blood sugar. It was 389. They came and told me to go straight to the ER.

I did, and my blood sugar was 322 at the ER. They gave me fluids and insulin, and said I needed to meet with my GP ASAP. The doctor said she thinks it’s either Type 1 or 1.5, due to my age and the fact I’m not obese (177 lbs). She said they couldn’t tell me what type and that I needed to call my GP in the morning. At discharge, after insulin and fluids, my blood sugar was 150. The doctor at the ER also let me know that my HA1C was 12, suggesting I’ve been diabetic for months.

This morning, I went to not my GP, as my GP is booked out to December. I met with a doctor who looked at my records the ER sent over, and agreed that I have diabetes. He also said he thought it was Type 1. I was sent for labs (8 vials of blood and urine sample). He also prescribed a short term insulin and a long term insulin, as well as a glucose meter. He didn’t give me much info on how to use them or when to use them, but thanks to a very helpful pharmacist, I have the basics.

I went home, and checked my blood sugar for the first time (180, about 2 hours after I had lunch). I was told by the doctor to do the short term insulin two hours after every meal, and before bed, but the pharmacist said before meals. I don’t know. But I decided to do my first insulin injection. I panicked and started sobbing and my mom had to do it for me. It wasn’t bad at all and I’m going to try again by myself tonight.

The doctor also emphasized water, and said I should really follow a Keto diet until I see an endocrinologist (they referred me, I’m waiting for the call). 

Unfortunately, I’m a college student who’s 40 minutes from home. It’s a pretty small school and we only have 1 dining hall, and 4 alternative food options, all 5 of which are closed by 9 pm. They don’t share nutritional information but they do post a menu. I looked at it today, and I can only eat 1 thing that’s low in carbs besides a salad. I also don’t have money nor a kitchen to cook food for myself consistently. 

I’m honestly terrified because it’s a lifelong disease and I already struggle with taking my medication. I know I’ll learn and grow but I’m scared. I’m glad they caught it, and they can treat it. I’ve been feeling awful for nearly two months (fatigue/extreme exhaustion, decreased appetite, weird vision spells, urine issues) and was blaming it on the stress of school. I’m glad to learn those are all due to the diabetes and may improve over time. 

Anyways, if you read this far, thank you.

Busted my ass to prevent this from happening and now I’m not sure what to do?

I guess I’m just frustrated. But I should’ve seen it coming, my sister was diagnosed when she was around my age and she’s even smaller than me.

They are *not* trying to give you bad advice, they just are doing what they are told. Here are a few examples from my history.

1) I had a surgery in the morning. I was told not to eat or drink anything the night before, nor take any medicine. My best guess is those instructions were for Type 2, because if I had blindly followed instructions, I'd have not taken my long term insulin that I take at night, and my blood sugars would have skyrocketed by the time of my surgery to the point that they'd have had to cancel it. **edit: to avoid confusion, my issue here isn't the fasting. It's the no basal insulin.**

2) I have a Type 2 family member in the hospital for non-diabetes related reasons. His blood sugars were 163 and they wanted to give him some insulin. So I asked about that. I told them that I know we are different cases and all that but that if I was 163, just 1 unit of insulin would make my blood sugars low. Also, he has never had an insulin shot before, so this was a new frontier for him. And I asked nurse that as a Type 2, if the blood sugars get low, will his body compensate with a glucose release to stabilize and keep him from getting in trouble. She did not know how to answer that question. So then I said, ok, well, how long does the short term they're going to give him last? She kept saying ""10 minutes."" I couldn't figure out how to get her to understand that I wanted to know the total time the insulin would be in effect no matter how I phrased it. And keep in mind, I was not arguing, I just wanted clarification.

My point is, both people I talked to were kind, compassionate, and professional. They just weren't great at communication and understanding what they were doing as far as insulin goes. So if you, or your loved ones gets advice that's abnormal for your care, just double check with whoever your diabetes doctor is for clarification.",positive,0.9996840953826904,interested in clinical trials,positive,0.9998482465744019,positive experience with clinical trials,positive,0.9998698234558105,wants to participate in clinical trials

Needless to say I was devastated but sadly not surprised, they put me on metformin (2000mg!), isinopril and atorvastatin, sad part is I didn’t feel “sick” before diagnosis and so the first 2 weeks after starting medication everything was going well, however soon after I started to feel a multitude of symptoms that after some research I attributed to the medication, especially the statins.

I wish I didn’t have to get to that point to get the “kick in the butt” motivation needed, but I decided, “I’m gonna get this under control on my own” so I decided to ditch the medication, change my lifestyle  instead of “dieting” alone, so now it’s been almost 3 months without fast food, any kind of sugary drinks, or sweets for that matter, I’m eating a low carb diet rich in veggies and white meat, I’m doing intermittent fasting, I do cardio 5 times a week (almost) every week lol.

It wasn’t easy, especially at the beginning, but now I don’t crave sweets, or greasy burgers anymore, or coke or nothing really, and now it’s easier to get my cardio in, so I feel is sustainable, if I want a burger on a weekend for instance I make it myself from scratch (buns included) and fire up the grill, 1000% more delicious and way healthier. 

I’m down from 230lbs to 199lbs and I plan on keep going as I am, my guess is I will stop losing weight when I reach “caloric equilibrium”? If that’s even a thing lol, but like I said I’m not trying to diet, I changed my lifestyle, I’m still losing weight albeit slower now, so when I’m done losing weight I’m done losing weight.

Finally yesterday I had my labs and appointment, my A1C went down to 5.3, my glucose was 110 at time of drawing (4pm, 2.5 hours after my late lunch), cholesterol and triglycerides within normal levels, liver and kidney functions within normal range and blood pressure read 120/70.

I don’t know, I know it was a bit reckless to stop medication but I expected a pat on the back from the doctor and a “keep it up” after a stern “what you did was dangerous”. Instead she got upset and insists I should get back on ALL my medication and do lab work again in 4 months, I said “sure” but I’m seriously considering changing doctors and looking for a second opinion.

What are your thoughts guys? I’m sorry for the long post.

Edit: wow guys! I wasn’t expecting this response, I am really thankful for everyone who commented, I just got out of work, I’ll make sure to read through all the comments, I’ll post am update here in 4 months or before if I decide to see another doctor and see how things go, again, thank you all, I appreciate you all ☺️.",positive,0.9978220462799072,interested in clinical trials,positive,0.9978220462799072,positive experience with clinical trials,positive,0.9978220462799072,wants to participate in clinical trials

diabetes,I'm worried,Revolutionary_Mine47,2024-10-09 09:03:34,26,1fzs66m,https://i.redd.it/poxjn7r8mqtd1.jpeg,"To preface, my dad was diagnosed when he was in his 40s (now 61). He's always been very lax and leisure about it, not really caring or doing the absolute bare minimum for it. My mom does her part with the food and encouragement and luckily he does pay attention and is compliant with his meds and insulin treatment. In the past year or so he's developed glaucoma and had to get laser eye surgery as a result. Since then he's been very well about his condition and taking care of himself. 

Now I've started medical school (almost done with my first year), and learning about his condition really showed me what kind of condition it is. I've begun to encourage my dad more to take care of himself and he has and I'm so happy about it! 

It makes me so happy and I tell him I'm proud that he's been exercising more, eating better, being more active, heeding his doctor's advice. 

However, sometimes it makes me incredibly sad knowing about the what if's and how's and why's of it all. 

Now the current issue is after his last eye surgery 1 month ago, in the past week and a half to 2, he's started to get teary eyed in one eye and his eyelid seems swollen. If anyone has had this issue could you PLEASE provide some insight? 

I asked him about it this morning as he was leaving for work and he said it's annoying cause he just feels his eye tearing up and it gets itchy and he feels his vision get cloudy.

To me, it looks like it might be some sort of reaction because 2 weeks ago it was not the case. And hearing this it made me really sad because although I can't feel the pain and frustration and exhausting he feels, I feel I understand it, and it really saddened me. 

Overall, I guess i'm looking for some sort of semblance of advice, or just words to find comfort in all this.

diabetes,Why can't type 2 diabetics take more insulin for carb heavy meals like type 1 diabetics?,altgirl00,2020-12-03 13:37:38,0,k64fmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/k64fmh/why_cant_type_2_diabetics_take_more_insulin_for/,"I would like to suggest that the insulin resistance theory, currently considered the causative factor of Type 2 diabetes, is based on a biased interpretation of research studies than on science based on evidence.

The most noted test claiming to validate the theory is called a Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. For the test, insulin is infused at a constant rate and glucose is infused at variable rates into the vein of a subject. The rate of glucose infusion is adjusted to maintain a specific blood glucose level, depending on how much glucose the liver is producing. If the liver is producing a large amount of glucose, less of it is infused in the subject, and vice versa. 

From this test, it has been determined a diabetic liver appears to be insulin resistant because it continues to release glucose even when insulin is being infused into the subject.  Using radioactive-labeled glucose it was determined that muscles are resistant to insulin because they do not accept glucose under the same test conditions.

In both cases, the liver showing increased release of glucose and muscles showing reduced entry of glucose, the actual insulin resistance has not been measured. 

Nevertheless, experts in diabetes always present this test as the gold-standard method of proving the existence of resistance to insulin. This is similar to conducting tests to determine a person’s emotional intelligence and presenting that score as that of their intelligence quotient (IQ). The two tests may be similar, but they prove different things.",positive,0.9988054037094116,interested in clinical trials,positive,0.9998973608016968,positive experience with clinical trials,positive,0.999890923500061,wants to participate in clinical trials

I'm going to try it, monitoring my blood sugars, as a science experiment, to get answers once and for all, but..

I've never met or heard of anyone successfully managing their type 2 diabetes in this manner, so was wondering what Reddit's consensus was? There are a few reviews for the book of people doing it, but they seem to have been prediabetic and then lost a lot of weight due to the lifestyle change and I believe that's the largest contributing factor of why it was helpful for them. I've lost all my weight and that didn't help.

Have any of you met anyone who has used a low fat, whole food plant-based diet to manage their T2 diabetes?",positive,0.9995152950286865,interested in clinical trials,positive,0.9987640380859375,positive experience with clinical trials,positive,0.9998247027397156,wants to participate in clinical trials

Researchers in the School of Psychology, Queen's University Belfast, are undertaking an online study aimed at assessing what it is like to live with Type 2 Diabetes. The study focuses on the psychological implications of having the condition and the factors that might influence how people cope.

Considerable attention has been paid to the physical symptoms associated with Type 2 Diabetes. Our understanding of what it is like to live with Type 2 Diabetes, however, is very limited. This research aims to determine what it is like to have Type 2 Diabetes, focusing, in particular, on the psychological health implications of this condition. Your participation will help us to understand more about what it is like to have Type 2 Diabetes and be of potential value in the shaping of future health care and policy.

We are currently seeking participants with Type 2 Diabetes to complete our internet-based survey.

i'm black american type 2 diabetic, 29 years old. 240lbs. A1C was at 9 when last went to the doctor. 

Was prescribed to once a day 1000mg of metphormin. 

its been a few months and I've heavily altered my diet. Cut out rice, breads, pasta, cereal, etc. 

Breakfast i basically make an bacon and cheese omlette with veggies, a waffle that i use to make a little taco type thing, and coffee with 2 splenda and take my metphormin then. 

&#x200B;

The question I would like to ask is it bad if I basically fast the rest of the day? 

Just drink water and maybe like a nutri-grain bar if i get hungry till the next day??? 

&#x200B;

My family keeps trying to get me to eat even when im not hungry even though they know i'm diabetic and work from home on a computer so not very active.  

I understand excercise is a thing i need to incorporate into my life but if i'm not hungry at all do i still NEED to snack as they say. They keep saying I need to eat SOMETHING even if its small but i feel like eating at all just makes me overeat/stop my work flow. Is it really harmful to me if I eat say at noon and then dont have a big meal until the next day at noon again??? 

&#x200B;

I wake up with between 100-120 on the blood sugar checking meter thing (dont know its real name lol) and never really dipped under 90 when i do this but my parents swear up and down that not eating for long periods of time is harmful to me.

I've had thyroid issues my whole life but suddenly the idea that I can be diabetic is scaring me, I've been having little breakdowns and trying to cope for the last 2 days 
It hasn't been pretty 

He's put me on semaglutide but since he didn't formally diagnose me, I'm having to pay out of pocket since insurance won't cover it for only weight loss reasons 

He said the best thing for me to do right now is to take the semaglutide, focus on trying to eat better and lose weight 

I'm not sure how to get better
Mentally I feel like I've lost my sanity, I was so afraid that my sugar was so high and I was going to faint yesterday that I called EMS and they tested my blood and they said it was perfectly normal, that's how in my head I am

I feel myself becoming unsure about food and having little to no desire to eat as I'm afraid every single thing will cause more harm.

I don't have a follow up for another 3 months and i don't know how to cope with this and make changes that are healthy and not detriment. I just wanted to see any advice on how to start

Newly diagnosed

I decided to go see my endo…guess what I got in the mail??

He’s leaving the practice and doesn’t say where he’s going..So while I find a new doctor I wanted to ask if anyone else experiences this and what they did.

My story:
I went to the ER for extreme itchyness and my blood sugar was 400. Was diagnosed with type 2.

Current issue:

I get randomly itchy around my neck elbow and groin..this seems to occur less when I control my sugar intake. Any suggestions to avoid the itchyness? Even when my sugar is less and I work out it still can happen in the middle of the night.

This is a daily worry. 

About me: 

I am more active eating more veggies and take metformin extended release with my meals. 

I am getting better control of my cravings and exercising more. Recently started doing squats after meals to reduce blood glucose level. Seems to be working, will update

I play basketball and now that it’s warming up I’m starting play more frequently. 

I am 28 years old 5’8 240lbs.

In March, I was kicked off my dad’s insurance and had to go get my own. I am now being kicked off my insurance at the end of the month because they “don’t have enough evidence to prove I’m diabetic”. Are they legally allowed to do this? I am terrified now because this means I will not be able to see my doctor next month or ever again until I get on insurance and I can’t even get it through work as it’s about $200 out of my paycheck that I need. Is there anything I can do to stop them from kicking me off of my insurance? Is there a way I can see my doctor without insurance. I have no knowledge on any of this.

I had gestational diabetes with my second pregnancy. I was diet controlled the entire time. My son was born on 8/6/23. He was healthy with no blood sugar issues. 

 Sometime shortly after my 6 week PP checkup I took the glucose tolerance test and passed it.  
Around 2 months PP started experiencing night sweats , headaches, sweating during the day, dry mouth, fast heart rate, chills, etc. it wasn’t going away so I made an appointment with my provider. 


I had my a1c checked on 12/7/23. It was 5.7% 
I also had my c peptide checked: 1.24 

 I got my a1c rechecked on 5/30/24. It was 5.1% During this time I got very strict, I wasn’t keto. But I ate way lower carb. I would only allow a handful of berries or an apple with plenty of peanut butter. I started exercising a bit more. I tracked my numbers religiously each meal and for fasting. I rarely had any cheat foods. 

 My most recent a1c done 9/13/24 was 5.6%. My fasting insulin was checked as well-it was 4.8

Between May and September-I did re introduce more fruits , had a few more cheat meals. I would have ice cream sometimes in the evening with my family-a small cup from a shop. Or we would get fast food for dinner. Overall though most days I still ate plenty of protein, veggies such as broccoli, cauliflower, spinach and kale. I also had my carbs from mostly black beans and quinoa. 

Eating this way keeps my blood sugar under 120 at 2 hours. This would be confirmed with a blood sugar meter. I didn’t check on my cheat meals as I didn’t want to obsess and wanted to enjoy myself a bit. I also added back in sweet potatoes. We found a pancake/waffle mix that has higher protein and lower carb. I would test my numbers and I would be normally under 120 at 2 hours if I ate 1-2 pancakes only. And had plenty of eggs and meat with it. Occasionally I would splurge and allow myself 3 pancakes and add peanut butter with them for a snack. This was not a daily occurrence. 

 Another change during the past few months has been an increase in exercise. I run 2-3 times a week. I also do at home workouts with dumbbells and kettlebells. I mostly try to eat higher carb before workouts and it does wonders for me. I feel amazing during my workouts. I am so confused. 

My primary DR says I have nothing to worry about. He thinks I just had GD and am not diabetic. I saw an endocrinologist and he said the same, doesn’t think I’m diabetic. Just recommended to keep exercising and eating lower carb. 

 Recently though I did my own at home Glucose Tolerance Test. I purchased the 75G glucose drink and tested myself fasting, 1 hr, and 2 hr. I failed miserably. And crashed at the 3 hour. 

Here were my results: Did at home glucose test  

96-fasting 

 231-1 hr 

 215-2 hours 

 69-dropped at 3 hours ; I felt off like warm in my face. Felt off. Slightly buzzed almost. And shaky.   

63-10:37 am After this ate eggs, pork belly. Also had 2 pancakes with butter and peanut butter, along with yogurt. My blood sugar finally started going up after.

 77-10:46 am 

 73-11:51 am 

 72-12:06 pm 

Then 103 1-2 hours after food 

 I’ve read that you have to eat 150G for 2-3 weeks before you ever do a Glucose Tolerance Test? Is this true? I also know it’s not as accurate doing this yourself. But my husband did it with me.

I’m looking for some advice/insight on Metformin appetite loss. My dad is 67, has type 2 diabetes, and has been struggling with a complete loss of appetite for over 10 days. His caloric intake has been around 250-500 calories per day, and he’s becoming very weak and tired. We’ve tried encouraging him to eat more, but it’s been challenging. He started taking Metformin, two pills per day, 500mg each, about a month ago. It curbed his appetite initially, but then he could kinda eat. But now, he hardly eats anything.

He has gone to his doctor twice within those 10 days to voice his concerns, but the doctor seemed super relaxed about it. His approach was a wait and see kind of thing. And just yesterday on the last visit, the doctor recommended to stop the medication and wait and see if his appetite comes back. Then they could switch the medicine.

My dad also takes medicine for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. He used to take some kind of Chinese medicine for itchiness, but he recently ran out approximately 11 days ago. He thinks the Chinese medicine helped him eat all this time, Idk. About my dad, he's 5'6"", maybe 200 lbs. Slightly overweight with a protruding stomach. Maybe the doctor thought he could use some weight loss, Idk.

Has anyone else experienced a similar situation? I'd really love your feedback or guidance. I feel powerless, and it's starting to piss me off. I know the solution--eat. Consume like 1,000 calories a day. I've been talking to ChatGPT about this, and GPT keeps telling me to go to the ER.

Oh, also, my dad says he's fine, just tired/weak. No headaches or dizziness. Just no energy. He's still down to ""wait and see."" Well, I'm tired of waiting. We need to make things happen already. We need actionable solutions.

I was just chatting with ChatGPT when I realized I should be asking a forum, so here I am. I'd rather do too much than regret doing too little. Thanks for reading, and thanks for any advice you can offer. Also, I bought a blood sugar test thing from Amazon, which should arrive in a day or less.

  
Update: 7/4/24

After stopping Metformin for two days now, my dad's appetite has been slowly coming back. Thank you all so much for taking the time to read and advise me on how to deal with this stressful situation. I really appreciate it. I'm completely new to this, and this forum has been a source of comfort for me, knowing y'all have experience in dealing with the issue.

I wanted to get everyones thoughts. 2 weeks ago I took a trip down to mexico to visit my family, my mother convinced me to see her dr because i hadn’t had a check up in about a year or so, since my dr retired. I have never been diagnosed as type 2 but i have been diagnosed as pre diabetic.., so i went ahead and went with her dr who ordered lab work. My fasting blood sugar came back at 96, which was crazy to me because when i check at home my fasting blood sugar is usually around 110.. anyway the thing that really surprised me was my A1C, it came back at 5.6… which was out of the pre-diabetic range.. barley. Anyway when i got back state side, i honestly felt that the numbers were too good to be true, so i purchased an on demand test from lab corp and got the results back today.. it came back at 6.5 for my A1C… im confused as to how these numbers can be so far off, one from saying im fine and now this one saying that im diabetic. I will be shopping around for a new primary care today and have further lab test done in the near future, but wanted your advice / thoughts.. is the test i did in mexico wrong? That was a full lab order… is the one I did yesterday wrong? And by saying wrong i mean impacted by something?

I have been on this medication along with doing reguluar excersize and eating healthy for about a month and a half, and ive lost just over a stone. Recently, i have been feeling extremly ill and have been non stop puking and diahhorea for past 3 weeks, i called my diabetes help line team who deal with my medication and they said its part of the process and if im loosing weight its all that matters, my mum has heard me throwing up and has been ignoring this and just keeps asking weight loss? and said maybe being sick is a good thing as means loosing weight faster and not storing food. I have been overweight my entire life and am fed up with how people treat me with my size, seeing how fast my weight is going down especailly since now the vomiting has become an every day thing, i feel im becoming addicted to doing it i feel guilty for eating, skip meals and when my partner tries to encourage me to eat i get annoyed and then will vomit once hes asleep however he always hears me and once out of bathroom, greeted with bottle of water and something small to eat. he is concerned for me but im loosing weight faster than i ever have before and i feel absolutely drained but i am seeing a difference in my looks, idk what to do or who to talk to .

Edit: thank you all for the support I haven't checked this post in a while as tbh with the sickness and feeling of tiredness got to the point I was in bed for days with 0 energy. I finally got ahold of the diabetic nurse and told her everything i written here and more she was mortified with my mums attitude and said my bf is just caring and how i shouldnt feel any sort of guilt im doing well but understands the sickness can get too much she lowered my dose which worked wonders and booked me a appointment to speak to the mental health team. I just cried the moment I walked In. I didn't realise how much my mental health and physical health has been getting to me and how negative my thoughts were and they agreed I was on the path to an eating disorder if I didn't change my ways of thinking and how vomiting doesn't loose weight it's a toxic idea which doesn't work I feel so stupid for having that idea but they agreed I wasn't getting the best support around me and needed to focus on one pound at a time and I'm still a person. The vomiting immediately went away and so did the diahorrea with the tablets and I'm still loosing weight which is great. I think having a lot of stress with people around me and the pressure to be thin made me go bit mad.

I take short acting (LisPro) and long acting (Lantus SoloStar) insulin injections with meals and nightly, respectively. 

I keep all my diabetes related necessities in a fanny pack I go everywhere with. I traveled to my hometown this weekend, a 4-hour drive, to visit family and take care of some things that needed my attention. 

Unfortunately, I didn’t check to see how many pen needles I had before leaving. I don’t have enough to have 3 meals a day and my nightly long acting for the time I’ll still be in my homework before driving back to my primary residence. Even if I skipping breakfast (which I usually do) I wouldn’t have enough, I’d have to just do 1 meal a day and my nightly. 

I could feasible do that, or I’ll just have a salad for lunch and not take insulin which I’ve done before. I am just looking for options that I have to not run out while I am away from home. 

The prescription for my pen needles isn’t up for a refill, so I can’t transfer the prescription to nearby pharmacy quickly. I’ve seen online that CVS sells similar, but not the same, pen needles (I don’t think they are in stock near me right now so this wouldn’t be an current option for me but I am curious about the compatibility of different pen needles with the insulin pens that I use), I have the BD Ultrafine short 8mmx31g pen needles prescribed to me. 

I imagine getting the same gauge would be the most important part of using different pen needles. That, and like the diameter and threads and such of the connecting bits of the pen needles. 

Does anyone have experience with using needles other than what is prescribed to them?",positive,0.9999165534973145,interested in clinical trials,positive,0.9998579025268555,positive experience with clinical trials,positive,0.9999151229858398,wants to participate in clinical trials

What type of questions should I ask her? I have a list of questions like how to deal with symptom management and timing of medications and what not. But any other questions you wish you knew or could ask a pharmacist?!

She probably can’t tell me treatment options so probably more specifically any questions I should ask or know about metformin or ozempic.

I'm a late 30s female who's been tackling type 2 diabetes with the help of traditional blood glucose monitoring (BGM) for quite a while. Lately, I've been contemplating whether to switch to a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. The cost seems steep, and not many of my peers are using it, which makes me wonder.

I'd love to hear from both sides: those who are using BGM and those who have opted for CGM. If you're on CGM, which brand do you prefer—Libre, Dexcom, or others? And for my BGM folks, what keeps you sticking with it?

Your insights would really help me navigate this decision better!

My blood glucose test was perfect normal both fasted an unfasted, but they did not test for a1c. I am getting that done in the next few days. Blood work was mostly normal, with the exception of a high normal hemoglobin, high normal AST (liver function) and slightly elevated blood creatinine which made my egfr (kidney function) at 67%. will be getting cystatin C along with a1c for more accuracy of kidney function. Being a weight lifter, creatinine can be higher which can falsely skew the egfr kidney function test.  My original complaint was mild discomfort in my upper left abdomen, and mild neuropathy in hands and feet, frequent urination especially at night and just generally feeling unwell and tired. CT scan discovered mild splenomegaly (swollen spleen) and an adrenal adenoma (benign growth on adrenal gland). Doctor determined from that I was just dehydrated, advised drink 80oz per day and return in 4 weeks for retest. Dedicated to hydration and cleaner (not perfect) eating and returned for retesting. Numbers were slightly improved but not much.

Fast forward 3 months and not feeling much better, if not slightly worse. Slightly numb hands and burning feet have returned, with an intermittent warm sensation on my calf which indicates nerve damage. Wife has been commenting that I look pale.  Diet has been better, but far from what someone with type 2 diabetes should be doing. Long story short, im returning for additional testing with a different doctor, since the first doctor was not thorough, and fairly disregarded my symptoms, especially the swollen spleen which should be a huge red flag for more diagnostics in any case. Im pretty well prepared to be told im either pre-diabetic, diabetic, or worst case scenario im not diabetic at all and there is something more sinister at play.
